							<h2>Who am I</h2>
							<p>
								I am a multidisciplinary professional with a deep love for both architecture and technology. My journey started in the realms of architectural design, where I discovered the beauty of creating sustainable and functional spaces. This love soon expanded to encompass technology, where I saw endless possibilities to innovate and optimize. Today, I blend these worlds, leveraging my expertise to craft solutions that not only meet aesthetic and functional needs but also push the boundaries of what's possible.
							</p>
							<h2>My Trajectory</h2>
							<p>
								My career journey began with a passion for sustainable design and a drive to push the boundaries of architectural innovation. Over the past decade, I have led and contributed to numerous projects that have garnered recognition for their creativity and impact. I am proud to have been awarded at the 9th Biennial of São Paulo, where my work was celebrated for its visionary approach to sustainable architecture. Additionally, I have had the honor of being invited twice to the Venice Biennial, where my projects were showcased for their integration of parametric design principles and sustainable practices.

Throughout my career, I have embraced challenges in various sectors, from residential and commercial projects to urban planning. Each opportunity has allowed me to refine my skills in feasibility studies, construction management, and compliance, while also pursuing my passion for innovation. I transitioned into the realm of computational design and programming to bridge architecture with emerging technologies. This evolution has fueled my ongoing exploration in machine learning, automation, and computational design.

Now, as a master's candidate in Computer Science, I am committed to integrating these technological advancements into architectural solutions, creating designs that not only fulfill aesthetic and functional goals but also meet the growing demands for sustainability and innovation. My trajectory continues to be defined by the pursuit of excellence and a passion for redefining the possibilities in architecture and technology.
							</p>
							<h2>My Skills</h2>
							<p>
								My skills span a wide range of disciplines, from traditional architectural design to programming and data science. I am proficient in backend development, Java, Python, and computational design tools. I have a strong foundation in computational theory, with a keen interest in formal languages and automata, and practical expertise in using BIM tools for architectural management. This blend of skills allows me to approach problems holistically, finding creative solutions that others might not see.
							</p>
							<h2>How i learn</h2>
							<p>
								I learn by diving deep into projects, always searching for new challenges and technologies to explore. Whether it's coding a new algorithm, designing a sustainable building, or curating architectural history, my approach is hands-on and curious. I believe in continuous growth through self-improvement and formal education, which is why I regularly pursue certifications and advanced studies to keep my skills at the forefront of both architecture and technology.
							</p>
							<h2>
								What motivates me
							</h2>
							<p>
								My motivation comes from a desire to connect the digital and physical worlds in meaningful ways. I am driven by the potential of technology to solve complex architectural challenges and make spaces not only functional but also delightful. I am passionate about using my knowledge to create sustainable, inclusive, and intelligent environments that improve people's lives and push the boundaries of design and technology.
